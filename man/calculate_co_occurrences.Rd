\title{Calculate code co-occurrences in annotations}
\usage{
calculate_co_occurrences(annotations)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotations}{Data frame containing annotations with columns:
\itemize{
\item start: numeric, starting position of annotation
\item end: numeric, ending position of annotation
\item code: character, code identifier
}}
}
\value{
Table object containing frequencies of code pairs that co-occur,
with code pair names as "code1 & code2"
}
\description{
Analyzes text annotations to identify and count instances where different codes
overlap or co-occur in the same text regions. Handles edge cases and provides
error-safe operation.
}
\details{
Co-occurrences are identified by finding overlapping text regions between
different code annotations. The function sorts annotations by position and
checks for overlaps between each pair of annotations.
