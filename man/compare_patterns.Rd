\title{Compare coding patterns between different coders}
\usage{
compare_patterns(coding_strategies)
}
\arguments{
\item{coding_strategies}{List of coding strategies, where each strategy contains:
\itemize{
\item coverage: List containing density and distribution information
\item code_patterns: List of code application patterns
\item combinations: List of code combination patterns
\item sequences: List of code sequence patterns
}}
}
\value{
List containing comparison results:
\itemize{
\item coverage_differences: Analysis of coding density variations
\item code_differences: Analysis of code application differences
\item combination_differences: Analysis of code combination patterns
\item sequence_differences: Analysis of code sequence patterns
}
}
\description{
Analyzes and compares coding patterns between different coders by examining
various aspects including coverage, code application patterns, combinations,
and sequences.
}
\details{
The function performs multiple comparisons with error handling for each aspect
of coding patterns. Returns descriptive messages when analysis cannot be
performed due to insufficient data.
